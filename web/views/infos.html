      <h4>2023/07/09</h4>
      <p>Hello @randomizer,</p>
      <p>We've released a new version of the VARIA Randomizer, Solver, Tracker, Plandomizer and Customizer (https://varia.run/).</p>
      <p>🪞 You can now play the game horizontally mirrored! This has been made possible by integrating the Super Mirrortroid hack by @BuggMann (https://metroidconstruction.com/hack.php?id=622). In mirror flavor all rooms, including bosses/mini-bosses are mirrored. All VARIA features are available in both vanilla and mirror flavors.</p>
      <p>🗒️ The recently introduced objective system has been extended. There is now a distinction between "possible objectives" (the objective list in the seed) and "required objectives" (the actual number of objectives to complete from this list). This allows for more strategic play, by completing objectives that work well together. For this to be interesting, we had to expand the maximum number of objectives (9 max required, 18 max possible). Try it out with the "objectives_bingo" settings preset!</p>
      <p>🗺️ The in game map has been enhanced as well, using the awesome Map Overhaul patch by @MFreak as a base. The room connections are visible, as well as major/minor item locations adapted to the seed's item split. Each VARIA area has its own color, consistent across the vanilla area maps. The door colors and area/boss portals are dynamically tracked and shown as map icons. When applicable, objectives are visible on the map.</p>
      <p>▶️ Speaking of map, the tracker/plandomizer user interface has been remade by @chrisc! On top of mirror support it features seamless change of map style, smooth resizing, different item trackers, an improved seedless mode etc. </p>
      <p>Other new stuff:</p>
      <h4>rando:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>objectives:  new map completion based objectives</li>
        <li>objectives:  new "Hidden objectives" option for random objectives: the objective list is hidden until you reach G4 (or equivalent)</li>
        <li>rom: improved objective screen with detailed progress display</li>
        <li>rom: new ending screen showing RTA time, item%, and item collection details</li>
        <li>rom: show RTA timer in the pause menu</li>
        <li>rom: new HUD/message boxes/pause screen font</li>

        <li>doors: no plasma doors when super fun combat is on</li>
        <li>presets: save/load rando presets to/from disk</li>
        <li>layout: in area rando, removed the platform in green hill zone (reduced the above overhang instead)</li>
      </ul>

        <li>patches: don’t open Ridley door when he’s dead when HUD is on in non-Scavenger seeds</li>
        <li>logic: added missing access to Mickey Mouse missiles from Firefleas (was previously only in logic from LN entrance)</li>
        <li>and more...</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>2022/11/01</h4>
      <p>Hello @randomizer,</p>
      <p>We've (finally!) released a new version of the VARIA Randomizer, Solver, Tracker, Plandomizer and Customizer (https://varia.run/). This is a pretty humongous one.</p>
      <p>You can now choose the objectives required to trigger the endgame. The endgame itself can be Vanilla Tourian, Fast Tourian, or just trigger the escape sequence. It is of course possible to randomize these settings, and they are fully supported in the Solver/Tracker/Plandomizer as well.</p>
      <p>Objective settings are in the Medium or Advanced tab of the Randomizer page. Choose or randomize from 0 to 5 objectives, from a pool of 37 possible goals about bosses, mini-bosses, area/item completion, or memes! Be sure to use the help (?) button of the setting for details.</p>
      <p>At any point, objectives status can be checked in the pause screen, along with an item% indicator (useful for item% related objectives). When objectives are not vanilla, the G4 statue sound effect is played when an objective is completed, and a notification is displayed if VARIA HUD is enabled. Objectives and Tourian status are also recalled before starting the game when they are not vanilla.
</p>
      <p>Special thanks @chrisc for your contributions to the web front-end! </p>

    <li>
      <h4>2021/08/02</h4>
      <p>Hello @randomizer,</p>
      <p>We've released a new version of the VARIA Randomizer, Solver, Tracker, Plandomizer and Customizer (https://varia.run/) featuring a new HUD and an auto tracker!</p>
      <p>The HUD is used in two brand new majors split :
        <ul>
          <li>Full Countdown: Randomize like Full and display in the HUD the number of remaining unique upgrades (everything but energy and ammo) in the current area.</li>
          <li>Scavenger (thanks to @Slappy for the idea!): you must visit a given number of locations in a mandatory order in a scavenger hunt, and collect items there. The scavenger locations are the 16 locations where a unique upgrade is in the vanilla game. The HUD shows the next location in the hunt (whole route available in the pause menu). You can choose how many locations will be in the hunt (between 4-16, defaut is 10), whether the items in the hunt locations will be vanilla (default), or whether the escape is immediately triggered when the hunt is over (by default, you still have to beat G4 and go through Tourian after the hunt is over). The remaining unique upgrades will be randomized between the remaining scavenger locations.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The HUD also enables the usage of Major/Chozo split with random start location (some locations are changed, so the HUD is used to know how many Major/Chozo items are left in the current area). It can also be used as a standalone comfort patch. The area names in the HUD are the ones used by the area randomizer, so mind that Crocomire and Kraid’s Lair are their own areas for example.
        You can play around with the options and/or try out the new settings presets starting with ‘hud_’ or ‘scavenger_’ to enjoy the new modes!</p>
      <p>Also featuring the VARIA Auto-Tracker to automatically track Area/Boss transitions, collected Items and Door colors as you play the seed, as long as you play on a platform compatible with <a href="https://github.com/Skarsnik/QUsb2snes/releases" target="_blank">QUsb2Snes</a>.</p>
      <p>Other new stuff:
        <ul>
          <li>tracker: highlight accessible rooms on the map</li>
          <li>tracker: reset door colors when clicking on items bin</li>
          <li>solver: removed minimal pickup strategy, only any% and 100% now</li>

      <h4>2020/09/16</h4>
      <p>Hello @randomizer,</p>
      <p>We've released a new version of the VARIA Randomizer, Solver, Tracker, Plandomizer and Customizer (<a href="https://varia.run">https://varia.run/</a>), featuring the new Boss rush minimizer! Try it out with the 'minimizer' settings preset!</p>
      New stuff:
      <ul>
        <li>rando: Create a 'boss rush' seed with a minimal layout by only connecting together enough areas to match the given number of locations (from 30 to 100, default 45). Boss and Area transitions are mixed together, Gadoras are removed, and you can exit boss fights at any point.</li>
        <li>rando: In 'boss rush' you can also speed up Tourian (on by default), to skip Metroids, Zebetites, and all cutscenes (including Mother Brain 3 fight).
        <li>area: Light Area Randomization option: we keep the same number of transitions between areas as in vanilla. For example, Crateria will always have two transitions to Green Brinstar, one to Red Brinstar, one to Wrecked Ship and one to Tourian.
      </ul>
      New minor stuff:
      <ul>
        <li>area: new save stations in West Maridia (it was the only area without any)</li>
        <li>customizer: option to restore vanilla behaviour for fanfare and fast doors/elevators transitions</li>
        <li>customizer: five custom ships are available (made by Red-M0nk3y)</li>
        <li>customizer: custom item's names in pickup message box for some custom sprites</li>
	<li>layout: bomb block replaced with a shot block at Mission Impossible room</li>
        <li>logic: added missing energy requirement for Draygon Grapple/Spark kill</li>
        <li>logic: added new techniques for 'low%' mini-boss fights</li>
        <li>preset: new technique for various Maridia wall jumps that were previously implicitly in logic. Enabled by default for all presets except newbie.</li>
        <li>preset: new technique to access items in West Sand Hole (aka Left Sand Pit) with just Hi-Jump</li>
        <li>preset: new technique: Precious Room Gravity Jump exit</li>
        <li>core: significant performance boost, thanks to a bunch of optimizations initiated by @cout</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>2020/07/02</h4>
      <p>Hello @randomizer,</p>
      <p>We've released a new version of the VARIA Randomizer, Solver, Tracker, Plandomizer and Customizer (<a href="https://varia.run">https://varia.run/</a>), featuring new areas, an algorithm update, and other cool stuff!</p>

        <li>rando: new "ultra sparse" energy quantity setting. Max 0-1 tank, Mother Brain's rainbow beam damage has been nerfed (20 with Varia, 40 with Gravity/Suitless)</li>
        <li>web: upload your vanilla ROM only once and it'll stay in your session</li>
        <li>web: get a permalink for generated seeds for easier sharing</li>
        <li>solver: separated difficulty info for path and location</li>
        <li>tracker: seedless user interface update. Now you can just click on the inventory instead of collecting locations (very handy for quick logic tests)</li>
        <li>rom: VARIA logo and version on the title screen!</li>
        <li>rom: new comfort patches available, Infinite Space Jump and Refill when saving</li>
        <li>customizer: new custom sprites, Link (by RonnSama) and Sprite (by TarThoron). Also by TarThoron, an awesome Dark Samus recolor, as well as a bunch of meme "Samus is rotated" sprites!</li>
        <li>techniques: added suitess Spring Ball access with Flatley Jump and Insane WRITG Wall Jump</li>
        <li>layout: Kraid save softlock protection</li>

        <li>plando: Plandository to store community plandos and VARIA weekly races seeds/plandos</li>
        <li>escape: escape randomization can now be used without Area Randomization</li>
        <li>escape: Animals Challenges in randomized escape. Find the hidden animals, or/and cycle through possible escapes by going to vanilla animals!</li>
        <li>preset: new techniques Crystal Flash Clip (suited and suitless variants), Firefleas Wall Jump, Dodge Lower Norfair Enemies</li>

        <li>tools: added a command line webservice client to remotely generate seeds</li>
        <li>doc: command line usage of rando and solver is now documented in README.md on GitHub</li>
      </ul>

    <li>
      <h4>2020/02/10</h4>
      <p>Hello @randomizer,</p>
      <p>We've released a new version of the VARIA Randomizer, Solver, Tracker, Plandomizer and Customizer (<a href="https://varia.run">https://varia.run/</a>).</p>
      <p>Now you can start your seeds from somewhere else than Landing Site (or Ceres). Choose a start location, or randomize it! Click on the attached screenshot to check out the start locations list (note: Red Brinstar Elevator and Golden Four are only available in Area rando).</p>
      <p>Thanks to folks in the VARIA Randomizer discord (https://discord.varia.run/) and #data-dev channel in SMZ3 discord for some of the starting locations ideas!</p>
      Important notes:
      <p>In area rando, the Key Hunter Room bottom door (vanilla door to Red Brinstar Elevator) and the vanilla door to G4 are now blue, since Crateria is no longer necessarily the start area.</p>
      <p>Early morph setting had to be modified to accomodate this new feature, and this has some significant consequences on standard start seeds with Early morph (like all tournament presets, so read carefully):</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Speed or Screw attack can now be in Blue Brinstar even with Early Morph enabled</li>
          <li>For skill presets who don't know the Blue Brinstar Ceiling D-Boost tech, such as newbie and SMRAT2020, Morph ball will always be vanilla</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      Other new stuff:
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>new technique to acces Spring Ball with Gravity+Grapple+HiJump: enabled by default in all presets except newbie and SMRAT2020</li>
          <li>new rando preset: 'where_am_i', area rando with random start location</li>
          <li>new rando preset: 'suprise', randomize a few significant settings (like quite_random), also randomizes start location, and whether the seed will be area/boss rando</li>
          <li>various bugfixes on Super Fun seed generation</li>
        </ul>

        Hello @randomizer,<br/><br/>

        We've released a new version of the VARIA Randomizer, Solver, Tracker, Plandomizer and Customizer (<a href="https://varia.run/">https://varia.run/</a>), dubbed "MegaSamus X"!<br/><br/>

        You can now change Samus sprites in the customizer. All the sprite sheets created so far with SpriteSomething (<a href="https://github.com/Artheau/SpriteSomething/releases">https://github.com/Artheau/SpriteSomething/releases</a>) have been integrated, for instance Megaman X!<br/><br/>

        Another cool new feature is the ability to use the Randomizer to complete your plando. This allows for fun stuff like creating your own custom map (you don't like Wrecked Ship? don't include it) for your seeds, or generate a seed after placing Varia at Ridley for example.<br/><br/>

        Note: to remove the bloat of the randomizer page, color randomization is now only available on the customizer page, don't worry it has not gone away!<br/><br/>

        Full changelog below.<br/>

        New stuff:
        <ul>
          <li>plandomizer: you can now use the VARIA Randomizer to complete your plando</li>
          <li>plandomizer: you can load the items and transitions of your base seed</li>
          <li>plandomizer: the item selection popup now display the items with icons</li>
          <li>customizer: you can now replace Samus sprite with custom ones</li>
          <li>randomizer: usefull tips are now displayed during randomization</li>
          <li>randomizer: new link "what's in the logic" next to the preset to display the techniques available for the Randomizer</li>
          <li>stats: the total percentage for each item is now displayed at the end (for Randomizer presets with Super Fun enabled)</li>
        </ul>
        Bugfixes:
        <ul>
          <li>solver: handle utf8 ROM filenames</li>

        Hello @randomizer,<br/><br/>
A big VARIA update and a domain name (https://varia.run/) for its first birthday!<br/><br/>
Chozo split, G4 randomization and color randomization are now available in the rando. You can also apply color randomization or other patches on existing seeds using the new customizer. If you think slowest progression is not trolly enough, use your imagination in the new plandomizer! Also, the item tracker can now work without a seed.
<br/>

        Hi @randomizer!</br>
        We updated the VARIA (https://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/) to fix two issues:
        <ul>
          <li>1) The "too much spospo" bug. Now, the probability you would have to fight it is ~30% in slowest/slow, ~5% in medium, and ~0% in fast/fastest. All in all if you choose a random speed, there is a 1/7 chance to have to do the fight.</li>
          <li>2) When "start at Ceres" was selected instead of "start at landing site", the stats counters in the credits were wrong and glitched out. It is now fixed, thanks @andrew (original credits/stats patch author), Smiley and PJBoy from metconst for their help, this was a tricky one to fix.</li>
          </ul>
        Enjoy!

        Using the presets (for each technique you can say if you know it and your perceived difficulty for it) from the solver we've made a new randomizer: the VARIA randomizer (Very Adaptive Randomizer of Items for Anyone)</br>
        It can be found here: https://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/randomizer</br>
        Its features:
        <ul>
          <li>generate a randomized ROM which can be finished using the techniques of the given preset</li>

        Hello,</br>
        We've added a few things to the randomized roms solver (https://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/):
        <ul>
          <li>display the number of techniques used to solve the rom</li>
          <li>in the spoiler display the techniques used for each location</li>
          <li>for each techniques display the rooms where it's used with links to the wiki</li>
          <li>update the CSS of the website</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        Hello,</br>
        With a friend we've developed a solver for the randomized Super Metroid roms: https://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/</br>
        Tell it what you know (and how hard you find particular tricks), and it'll tell you if you can finish your seed, and how hard it will be, without spoiling the seed.</br>
        It's useful for people who hasn't yet mastered all the Super Metroid tricks required by the randomizers.</br>
        Features:
        <ul>
          <li> works with randomized roms from Dessyreqt randomizer and (Total, Foosda, Leodox) randomizer</li>
          <li> somewhat realistic navigation algorithm</li>
          <li> pretty much all tricks and difficult rooms/areas have their setting, with video explanation when we found one, so you can actually learn the tricks if you want</li>
          <li> website front end</li>
          <li> save/load your presets on the website without having to create an account</li>
          <li> boss difficulty is estimated as well</li>
          <li> hell runs are taken into account in navigation</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
