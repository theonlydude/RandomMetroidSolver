;;; Reserve Tanks bugfixes By NoDever2 (https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=418)

;This patch does a few things:
;* Prevents the loss of invincibility frames when auto reserves activate (no more getting hit twice!)
;* Prevents heat damage when auto reserves activate
;* Prevents a crash when pausing while auto reserves are active.
;* Makes reserve tanks come filled up.
;* Makes reserve tanks not empty if samus is fully healed when they are used in auto or manual mode.
;* Fix jank where deselecting and reselecting refill button during manual refill causes it to resume.
;  Can also press A during manual refill at any time to stop refilling.
;If you think of other ways reserves can be fixed, let me know! This patch has been updated a few times to tweak some things and continue to make reserves less sucky.

;Patch written by Nodever2 on 1-6-2020. Another bugfix added by Benox50, see update log below.
;Please let me know if there are any problems, I am still learning.
;No freespace is used.

;UPDATE HISTORY
;{
;1-11-2020
;Prevented heat damage from being dealt while reserves are refilling.
;Delete everything below the first "BRA $18" to undo this.

;3-17-2020
;Made it so that the game no longer crashes if paused at the same time that auto reserves activate.
;This was accomplished by adding org $82DB73
;Credit to Benox50 for this fix!!

;5-17-2022
;Made it so that reserve tanks come full when picked up.
;Made reserve tanks preserve remaining energy when used if not emptied.
;Also fixed jank in the pause screen where if you're manually refilling, deselect and reselect the refill button,
;refill continues.
